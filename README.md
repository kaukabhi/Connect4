# Connect4

Implemented a Connect4 game without any graphical interface.

Steps to run the game:

I have created Connect4.java class. Run it and it will ask you to enter the grid size, column to drop the disc, disc color on every play.

Rules to play:

1. Enter the grid size 
2. Player 1 enters the column to drop the disc and the color of the disc (should be a number).
3. Then, player 2 does the same.
4. Both players play alternatively until the grid is full or one player wins. A player only wins when he/she is able to connect 4 discs successively either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Hope you have fun!
